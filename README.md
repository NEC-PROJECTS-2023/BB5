### Introduction
In a school or college, attendance is extremely important for both professors and students. Thus it's important to maintain track of attendance. The traditional technique of recording attendance in a classroom works just well when there are a few pupils present, but it becomes challenging and time-consuming when there are many. It takes a lot of time and energy to call out a student's name or roll number to take their attendance. As a result, all of the aforementioned worries can be assuaged by an automatic attendance system. Many institutions are now using automatic attendance recording systems. Biometrics and RFID systems are two examples of such systems. To give his or her attendance, a student must stand in line, which takes time. The system of mandatory attendance marking that is proposed in this project does not in any way conflict with customary teaching practises. The method can also be applied in situations like exam periods or other classes where being on time is crucial. This strategy substitutes more cumbersome, disruptive, and upsetting for kids during assessment sessions traditional student identification procedures such calling the student's name or looking at identity cards.Students must enrol in the database in order to be recognised. On-the-spot registration is made possible by the userfriendly interface.
